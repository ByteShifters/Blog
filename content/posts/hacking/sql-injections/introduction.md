## Introduction to Advanced SQL Injection Techniques

In the ever-evolving landscape of web security, SQL injection (SQLi) remains one of the most prevalent and effective attack vectors. Understanding the various techniques and strategies for exploiting SQLi vulnerabilities is essential for both attackers and defenders. This document introduces several key topics related to advanced SQL injection techniques, highlighting methods to extract sensitive information, bypass web application firewalls (WAFs), and generate errors from databases. 

### Topics Covered

1. [Add Custom Payloads Directly in SQLMap](../custom-payloads-in-sqlmap/)
   - Learn how to enhance your SQLMap operations by adding custom payloads tailored for specific vulnerabilities.

2. [Advanced SQLi Payloads and Techniques](../advanced-sqli-payloads-techniques/)
   - Explore sophisticated SQL injection payloads that go beyond traditional methods, enabling deeper database exploitation.

3. [Extracting DB Name with Forced Errors](../extract-database-name-with-forced-errors/)
   - Discover techniques to force errors in databases, revealing critical information such as database names and structures.

4. [Force Errors from Database to get SQLi](../force-errors-from-database-for-sqli/)
   - Understand the different ways to intentionally generate errors to gain insights into database queries and schema.

5. [Forcefully Generate Errors on Various DBMS](../force-errors-on-various-dbms/)
   - A detailed look at methods for producing errors across various database management systems, enhancing your SQLi toolkit.

6. [Other Advanced SQLi Payloads](../other-advanced-sqli-payloads/)
   - Dive into additional advanced payloads that can be employed in SQL injection attacks, expanding your attack capabilities.

7. [WAF Bypass Techniques for SQL Injection](../waf-bypass-techniques-for-sqli/)
   - Learn how to circumvent web application firewalls using various encoding and obfuscation techniques, ensuring successful exploitation.
